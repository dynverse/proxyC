# proxyC: R package for large-scale similarity/distance computation

This code was originally written for **quanteda** to compute similarity/distance between documents or features in large corpora, but seprateted as a stand-alone package to make it availble for wider usage.

```{r}
require(proxyC)
require(Matrix)

mt1k <- rsparsematrix(1000, 1000, 0.01)
mt10k <-  rsparsematrix(1000, 10000, 0.01)
mt100k <- rsparsematrix(1000, 100000, 0.01)

microbenchmark::microbenchmark(
    simil(mt1k, margin = 1, method = "cosine"),
    simil(mt10k, margin = 1, method = "cosine"),
    simil(mt100k, margin = 1, method = "cosine")
)

microbenchmark::microbenchmark(
    simil(mt1k, margin = 1, method = "cosine", rank = 10),
    simil(mt10k, margin = 1, method = "cosine", rank = 10),
    simil(mt100k, margin = 1, method = "cosine", rank = 10)
)

```
